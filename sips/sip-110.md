<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to introduce sTSLA, the synthetic asset that tracks the price of the shares of Tesla, Inc.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

sTSLA will be first out of many Synths that will allow traders to profit from bullish or bearish bets on the value of shares on some of the best-known publicly-traded companies.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

These Synth will be implemented in much the same way as the other long crypto Synth. The main idea idea is to use iterative approach.

Upon initial release, sTLSA will have following features:
- Market Closures
  - Trading will be stopped when the market closes see https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1356041428007149568
  - Keeper with a feed to market opening and closing times and holidays will suspend the synth for trading
  - Secondary market should be created using an AMM such as Uniswap or Balancer to allow trading of the synth after hours
  - There should be a SNX liquidity mining incentive for a sTSLA/sUSD pool to ensure deep liquidity for after hours trading. 

In later iterations following features will be introduced in stages:
- Stock Splits
  - Example: TSLA stock split recently occurred on August 11 2020 https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split
  - Stock splitting support needs to be iterated on. Research required into mechanisms to support such as
    - The ampleforth rebasing multiplier approach to splits when they occur and the trade offs for defi integration on a "rabasing" stock synth
    - Deploy a new stock synth that holders need to migrate to similar to the LEND AAVE migration
    - Use the sDEFI denominator approach to keep the price as is regardless. In the end it's exposure to price that matter % change-wise
- Dividends 
  - Following options can be considered:
  - No dividends. It's a derivative not the actual stock so just don't pay dividends
  - Mint from the debt pool dividends to all sTSLA holders
    - Requires sufficient counter mechanisms to reduce the debt pool
    - Pay from the feepool
    - Risk of not enough fees to pay dividends
  - Freeze kwenta trading shortly before annoucement and unfreeze on ex-div date. 
    - Also need to consider reverse-stock-split in the same manner as mentioned in Stock-Splits, using the denominator            
         
### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Additional crypto and stock Synths will add further utility to the Synthetix protocol. Iterative approach will help Synthetix to quickly release stock synths, while working on more complex stuff in the background.
